# PubPwn ![logo](pubpwn.jpg)
A simple wrapper to easly pwn connected devices (at your favourite Pub) from your smartphone XD</br>

Introduction
Often, when you are alone in the pub, you need to waste your time somehow.</br>
The idea was born few months ago, when I was really bored, in front of a pint of beer.</br>
The reason why I decided to create this repo is that: pwn from your smartphone is very hard!</br> 
The output is really unreadable and write commands is not so easy.</br>
For this reason I decide to automize the information gathering process using this script.</br>
N.B. they just are wrapper for other tools, nothing really special.</br>

As you can see, you have an easy interface to check alive hosts and scan their open ports.

* termux (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=it)
